# world-hello 
Hi, I am a 50 year old Army vet trying to learn some Modern skills 
that I can use to Mod (and create) my own video games.
I have been a gamer for 40 years and always wanted to see my homebrews as rendered games
now that I am out of the workforce, I thought this would be the time to try learning all the differant skills needed.
I am using "The Odin Project" to learn to code from scratch.
Lol! The last time I did any Coding was on a Commodore Vic 20, so this might take a little while.
But Im gonna have fun with it.
TTFN
